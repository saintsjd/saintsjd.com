title: Am I a fit?
tags:

I love the book the Dip by Seth Godin. It is a great analogy for almost any project. We start with excitement and energy. We get discouraged when we realize things are harder than we thought. But, if we stick it out, we reach inflection and things start to take off. 

But how do we know if the project we are committed to is going anywhere? How do we know if it will take off or just crash?

One test is vision.

The vision of the project and where it is going should resonate within you. Without even thinking the actions and thoughts should align with it. Part of this is communication from your team and leaders, but another aspect is just fit. Does the vision resonate with your soul. Are you able to act on impulse and have your actions align to it? Or do you struggle to know which way to go? Do you have to search for a next step or do your instincts take you there automatically?

If not, then I suggest the project you are on is not a fit. It is time to move on. To find a project where the vision for it comes to you naturally, instictually.
