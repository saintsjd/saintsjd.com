One way to look at it is make america great again. a longing for a past that was better. it assume that at some time in the past we arrived.

I don't deny that things might be worse for you than they were in the past. I get the yearning for a past that was better. the present has let some of down very hard. it is not ok.

it forgets that that time might have been better for me than I am now, but it might have been hell on earth for others. or so so. it also might not have been the best that could have ever been. it falsely assumes that at some point in the past we achieved the pinalce that there was not more to achieve that things were as good as they could get.

It limits our potential. Its nainve. romantizaed false view that tragically limited view of our potential as a country.

We never arrived. We have always strived for and acheived more. that we attianed something in the past that could never be improved or out done. or ever have again.

Its not as catchy. But I am looking for candidates who say let's make america better than it is. Who respected the tragedy and rprogress in our journey. Who know it is a long road. Who are optimistic who bet on the right side of history that in the long run optimisim is the investemnet that has pad over the long term time and time again. We dont take a stright line to progress. but we do make steps there and pass our best to the next generation.

While we have acheived some greatness ofr some citizens int he past there is som much we more we can be.

I'll look for canidates that say letz make america better than it is. more just mroe open more kind more conencte than it is today. a bigger more open table when more of us thrive more of us thrive.

america is still a great experiement one that i dearly want to thrive a goverment of the poeple for the people and by the peple shall flourish on the face of the earth. We hve long road ahead. I'll look for candiates looking forward reather than backward for thier inpriartions.
