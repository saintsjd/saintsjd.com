Recently I needed to install the python shapely library on an app on Heroku.

Shapely has a dependancy on the C Library GEOS which is not part of the base Heroku system. 

Here is how I complied, vendored the binary and ran shapely on Heroku. You can use this same process to vendor and run any binary dependancy on the Heroku platform.
