Engineering Ego
====

Falasies
1. That i am smarter than the folks who designed the system before me
1. That I have the best tools
1. That I can see into the future and am capable of designing a system that will endure

Truths
1. Chances are Not smarter. Just have different requirements.
1. nope. Someone will invent a better tool tomorrow.
1. impossible to know requirements of tomorrow. Only thing we know is something unforeseen will come up.

how do we change design in light of this?

Design and engineer knowing that the system I build will be replaced someday. 
1. Make the exit easy, 
1. the code small
1. and integration interface clear part easy.
