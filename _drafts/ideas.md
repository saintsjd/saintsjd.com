# The Definition of Done.

As engineers it is important that we keep in mind what it means to be done.

Done does not mean all the tasks it JIRA are complete.

Done means a user is using what I built. They are empowered by it. They love it. They are obsessed with it. They would be sad if it went away. As a dev team we have checked the boxes in JIRA. We have watched users use our tool. We obsessed over the space between JIRA tickets. so that users find joy using the thing that we built.

First two weeks of shapeup development cycle. Doesn't feel like full dev. Its mostly design. goals:
1. turn pitch into design, future README (readme driven development) and into list of must haves and nice to haves
2. review design with your users and your team 
3. review must haves and nice to haves with team and with users and stakeholders.

# measuring success in an organization and its culture

How deep within the org tree are you seeing potential reached and creativity unlocked? or, if you flip the org chart upside down... how high up the tree are you seeing potential reached and creativity unlocked? 

This idea that crushing the soul of your workforce is a good long term strategy is just totally wrong. how do we nurture the soul, creativity, and potential of our team?
