# The Definition of Done.

As engineers it is important that we keep in mind what it means to be done.

Done does not mean all the tasks it JIRA are complete.

Done means a user is using what I built. They are empowered by it. They love it. They are obsessed with it. They would be sad if it went away. As a dev team we have checked the boxes in JIRA. We have watched users use our tool. We obsessed over the space between JIRA tickets. so that users find joy using the thing that we built.

Team Board Option #3

- Sprint == Cycle
- Epic == Pitch
- Story == task
- Subtask == subtask
- Label == scope

# why cooldown

1. in case we over estimate - finish a pitch
2. address tech debt that we intentionally introduced in order to get user feedback faster
3. user feedback. you built something. go empower the world with it. it is not done until a user is using it. valuable feedback comes from that. this is time to respond to it
