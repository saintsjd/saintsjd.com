I installed Magento http://www.magentocommerce.com on a dedicated server with 2 Xeon processors and 4 GB of RAM. Often when adding products, editing them, or choosing a category in the admin Magento takes 5-10minutes to complete the Save operation. A “Please Wait” modal dialog appears for long periods of time while Magento is thinking. The operation always completes without error, but It often takes 5-10 minutes just to save a simple product.

I [asked for a solution in the Magento Forums](http://www.magentocommerce.com/boards/viewthread/53594/) and found one…

Following the the instructions in the DYI tuning section here

I installed each optimization individually to see which made the difference. I found the following:

- Apache KeepAlives enabled. This seems to help the category selection pages load much much faster.
- Modify the configuration for your MySQL server. No noticeable gain on performance. Products still take 5 minutes to save.
- APC or XCache. This one fixed the problem.

Installing xcache seems to have fixed the problem. Products now save in about 2 seconds.

Edit on November 15th, 2009:
I found this in the Magento System Reqs:
“Memory_limit no less than 256Mb (preferably 512)”
