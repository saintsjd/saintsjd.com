I often need to read websites offline when I am in the developing world or on an airplane. I [wrote an offline browsing solution a while back](http://www.saintsjd.com/malawi/blog/jon/offline_web_browsing.html) that worked, but now I found something much better.

When you need to download copies of websites to browse at a later time offline, use [httrack](http://www.httrack.com/).
