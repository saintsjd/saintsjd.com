Our HP6500a printer was pausing right in the middle of printing a page. Sometimes after long waits the full page would print, sometimes not. I tried many fixes: updating the driver, firmware... etc.

After much tinkering, I found the problem was a weak WIFI connection to the printer.  When I plugged the printer directly into our router with an ethernet cable everything started working great. The printer can now print big files and prints very fast.

Hope this helps some others out there with the same issue.
