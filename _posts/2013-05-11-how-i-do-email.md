One of the keys to happiness in the modern world... taming your inbox. At any given moment email is too often the excuse rather than doing something more producting. Too often an email notification inturupts a great thought or a solid hour of work with some not urgent that we make urgent.

I have battled email for a while now. Here are some things that work for me.

1. Use Gmail. It has an excellent search feature and stores all of your old email incase you ever need them for reference.
1. Turn off ALL email notifications on your phone and on your computer. Never let an email interupt your productive work time. If it is urgent people will find other ways to get a hold of you.
1. Don't make folders or categorize email.
1. Set expectations with your boss and co workers that urgent matters expecially after hours must be dealt with over the phone.

Here is how my email day goes.

Start the day by looking at progress priorities and challenges. Not your email. Get a clear picture of the one big thing you want to accomplish today.

Then, glance at your email for 10 minutes at most.

Archive most message which do require a response.

Quickly respond to anything that can be done in a line or two. Then archive it.

Things that need a longer response but are not urgent. Leave them read and sitting in your inbox. Respond to these during your scheduled email time.

Anything urgent schedule time on your callendar to get the work done. Leave the email in your Inbox.

Then... close your email!!! Open only at the scheduled email time. And follow the steps above.

Then close your email!

An hour before the end of the day open your email. and follow the steps from the morning. This means you'll leave work with clear email conscience.
