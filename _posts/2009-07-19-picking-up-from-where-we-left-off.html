Continuing, at last, from <a href="http://www.ituprising.com/malawi" target="_blank">where we left off</a>. Having wrestled with my thoughts from Malawi from a few years back, some still make sense.  Those ideas form the foundation for the discussion on this blog:
<ul>
	<li>Development is best defined as an increase in the amount of time that a person can foreseeably sustain their life into the future (See <a href="http://ituprising.com/malawi/blog/jon/pondering_poverty" target="_blank">Pondering Poverty</a>)</li>
	<li>Poverty is best defined as "a lacking of sustainability" (See <a href="http://ituprising.com/malawi/blog/jon/pondering_poverty" target="_blank">Pondering Poverty</a>)</li>
	<li>"I have come to believe more than ever in engineering, pure and empathetic put-me-in-your-shoes engineering, as one of the most effective strategies for realizing development." (see <a href="http://www.ituprising.com/malawi/blog/jon/digital_development" target="_blank">Digital Development</a>)</li>
</ul>
