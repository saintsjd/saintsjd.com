When we arrived in Malawi last February I was surprised to find organized soccer for girls in the northern region of Malawi.  Mzuzu has 15 teams that compete in the league.  Most of the teams belong to secondary schools (high schools) but a few are club teams.  I met with Tamala Banda, one of five female referees in the country, about coaching.  She helped search out a young and dedicated team for me to work with.  Before I knew it I was out on the ground (field) at the prison coaching Prison United.  The name is a bit misleading, as none of my girls are prisoners, but girls from 14-22 years old who come from different secondary schools around Masasa neighborhood.  </p>

    <div class="content"><p><span class="inline left"><a href="../index.html" onclick="launch_popup(117, 432, 324); return false;" target="_blank"></a></span> Yesterday was an absolutely increadible day.  It was a I'm-so-glad-I'm-in-Malawi day.<br />
Earlier last week Jon received a text message on his cell from a mysterious sender saying, "Hie Marissa - paintlady says be there Saturday26Aug". Which painter lady?  Lilongwe or Mzuzu? Who sent this?  I had so many questions, but we were hystarical with laughter because this baffled, utterly confused feeling has become such a part of life.</p>
<p>Eventually we found out that it was Isaac, a friend's housekeeper and my translator for art visits out to the villages.  What a sweet person!  He had set up a meeting for me to visit a family who paint murals on their house.  This would be my second visit, this time I was hoping to learn how they make their paints and conceive their designs.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>We had our first visitors in June.  Fran, Jon’s mom, and Kris, Jon’s sister, spent time with us in Mzuzu and traveling a few of the country’s tourist attractions (i.e. Lake Malawi, safari in Liwonde National Park, etc).  One of my favorite things is sharing our life with the people I love, so I was excited to have them see and experience everything from shopping at the markets, to visiting schools, to IT stuff with Jon at the University. </p>
<p>Over the two weeks, they heard many of our stories about the adventures of living and traveling in Malawi.  What surprised me was that time and again, Fran wasn’t surprised.  She was continually commenting that life in the States 30 or 40 years ago was much like the life we are living here in Malawi in 2006.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I am deeply impressed by the strength of people’s souls in this place.  Jon and I are have settled down enough, that we interact with Malawians on a daily basis and are developing many friendships along the way.  We have noticed that as we get more and more integrated into the community, death seems to take a stronger and stronger presence.  Just the other day we realized that it had been more than 2 days since hearing about the death of one person or another connected in some way to our friends or colleagues.  Learning to deal with death on a daily bases is hard, but what I find more challenging is learning to grasp how my Malawian friends go on living life with such joy, such strong spirits, always so helpful, always with a smile.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Last weekend, I turned our kitchen into a chemistry lab.  The Quest...to successfully make long lasting paint using only my hands and natural resources.  The Result…fabulous egg tempera paint!  </p>
<p><span class="inline left"><a href="../index.html" onclick="launch_popup(75, 499, 600); return false;" target="_blank"></a><span class="caption" style="width: -2px;"><strong>Egg Tempera Experiment</strong></span></span>I was inspired by a number of factors including Victoria Finlay’s book Color: A Natural History of the Palette, Malawian artists’ need of access to affordable paint, and personal curiosity.  Over the past few months I have been researching pigments and paint making techniques.  Egg tempera paint is one of the oldest paints known to man, even older than oil painting.  Some date egg tempera paint back to the first centuries AD, but it was most widely used in the Middle Ages with the Byzantine painters.  The Greek Orthodox Church has maintained the tradition, and up to the present still uses egg tempera for icon paintings.  In the secular world of art this tradition has seen a revival over the past 10 years.  So much so, that there is a great <a href="http://www.eggtempera.com/newforum/index.php">online forum</a> where you can read and participate in discussions about issues relating to egg tempera paint and painting</p>

    <div class="content"><p>This week I'm feeling more and more convinced that money can't solve anything around here.  That may be obvious, but it's a daily frustration as everyone from personal friends, to the staff that works at the house, and the random person on the street asks us for loans, money for their cousin in the hospital, school fees, food, anything and everything!  The challenge is...if you say yes once, the expectation is that you can help the next time, and the next person/people as well. </p>
<p>After developing a friendship, we decided to give a Malawian friend a six month loan of $100 to start a rice business.  We saw this as a personal investment and an opportunity to learn how business works in Malawi.  Our friend has great people skills, a lot of enthusiasm, some experience trading maize, and a large local network of friends who could be suppliers and potential clients.  We challenged him to do simple market research ahead of time and when through cost analysis and cash flow budget scenarios with him ahead of time.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I would challenge my friends and family back in the states to try this one out…<br />
Instead of putting your trash out on the street for pick-up next week, dig a small hole in your backyard and start dumping your waste there.  It will be amazing to see how quickly your consumption habits change and how environmentally conscious you become.  </p>
<p>As you can guess, this is the system for garbage disposal in Malawi.  Any trash we make, literally, make a landfill of our backyard.  In this light, composting is an absolute must.  Any organic waste gets dumped onto the compost pile, which will then be used as fertilizer in the garden where we will grow many of our own veggies and herbs.  Soda and beer bottles are all recycled, so much so that, cans aren’t stocked much at the stores and you get a refund on new beverage purchases when you return used bottles.  What a brilliant system!  Other recycling services do not exist, so we end up making all sorts of consumer decisions to minimize the size of the landfill in our backyard.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>This week Jon and I are finishing the website design for OIBM a micro-finance bank servicing the poor.  It's been really fun working with them b/c it's a crew of really motivated Malawians and I happen to really believe in the transforming nature of the services they are offering to the poor.<br />
I'm also preparing to head out on my art safari next week.  For me, this means practicing with watercolors and some other materials, doing some drawing studies, etc.  I'm really excited to see more of the country and work with other artists. </p>
<p>I feel like I have my hands and my mind in a little bit of everything (art, humanitarian aid distribution, web design, micro-enterprise, jewelry making research, bird watching, and peanut butter making!).  Obviously, there are a lot of needs here in Malawi with the challenges of disease and poverty.  I'm not sure yet how to feel about prioritizing my time while I'm here.  On the one hand, a year is a very short time to see any of my contributions materialize in a major way.  I feel like I need to do "good work" (like volunteering at the hospital or public schools), but then I remember what I learned through my teaching experience, and that is that I must follow my passion and my giftings.  I think those things are art and business (income-generating activities).  I'm praying that God will show me ways to use these things to bless Malawians while I'm here.  There have been little windows of opportunity...like exchanging painting classes for wood carving lessons with some of the local carvers...or maybe teaching jewelry making techniques to women in villages nearby so they can sell jewelry to tourists.  I have plenty of ideas but getting the ball rolling and trying to get more involved in the local community is a slow process...I need patience, otherwise I start to feel discouraged, like I'm not doing anything useful.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Jon and I are hoping to purchase our car today and be on our way upto Mzuzu.  In the mean time, we have had some fun times taking the mini-buses around town.  Sheila's Lodge, where we are staying, is about a 30min walk from the nearest stop. On our way, we pass beautiful flowering trees, bright red and yellow birds, butterflies galore, and LOTS of people.  There are all kinds of foot paths darting every which way off the paved roads...the Malawians call them "shortcuts"…they usually lead through the maize fields that are integrated into this semi-urban landscape, and off to neighboring villages.  The women carry all kinds of things on their heads, 40lb sacks of grain, sugar cane bundles, and loads of firewood...not to mention a baby strapped to their back!  Like Jon says, they are stronger than ants.  Even though we are staying in a neighborhood where many expats live, the kids get a kick out of seeing us walking down the road (I guess most white people are using cars around here).  As we approach kiddos we hear them say "ooo...mzungus!!!!" Mzungu is the word for foreigners or white people.  We get a kick out of it too.</p>

World Care is directed and founded by Lisa Hopper, a former teacher, who has experience shipping aid supplies to more than 30 different countries over the last ten years. Hopper and her volunteers are especially experts in getting books and school supplies into the hands of children and communities in developing countries.</p>
<p>This will be World Care’s first shipment to Malawi, for which they are partnering with Dr. Wayne Decker and his International Studies students from the University of Arizona.  Three students are responsible for fundraising the $15,000 needed to cover transport costs, while World Care will provide all of the supplies to fill a 40ft shipping container. This is serious business!</p>
