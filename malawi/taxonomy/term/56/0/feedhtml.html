 <title>Meet the Scorpion Sisters (a.k.a. Prison United)</title>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;inline left&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/malawi/&quot; onclick=&quot;launch_popup(134, 384, 288); return false;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; style=&quot;width: -2px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scorpion Sisters Football Team: &lt;/strong&gt;Scorpion Sisters (a.k.a. Prison United)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Unbeknownst to most Mzuzuites, there is a booming Women’s Football League in Mzuzu and the surrounding areas.  When we arrived in Malawi last February I was surprised to find organized soccer for girls in the northern region of Malawi.  Mzuzu has 15 teams that compete in the league.  Most of the teams belong to secondary schools (high schools) but a few are club teams.  I met with Tamala Banda, one of five female referees in the country, about coaching.  She helped search out a young and dedicated team for me to work with.  Before I knew it I was out on the ground (field) at the prison coaching Prison United.  The name is a bit misleading, as none of my girls are prisoners, but girls from 14-22 years old who come from different secondary schools around Masasa neighborhood.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;inline left&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/malawi/&quot; onclick=&quot;launch_popup(137, 360, 476); return false;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; style=&quot;width: -2px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tamala Banda, Referee&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;I’m still a little fuzzy on the history of the team.  I believe that it was started for the wives of prison guards, but when that didn’t catch-on these younger girls started joining and the rest is history.  Just recently our name was changed to Scorpion Sisters because the Scorpion Youth Organization sponsors the team by paying for transportation and membership fees.  I team coach with Kennedy Mbewe a prison guard and very good and caring coach.  We practice everyday and are meant to have games each weekend.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;inline left&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/malawi/&quot; onclick=&quot;launch_popup(135, 324, 432); return false;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; style=&quot;width: -2px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah and Kiddy at Training&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The girls are brave.  Let me paint the picture for you…most only own a few outfits…meaning a few shirts, two skirts and maybe a school uniform.  Most of them have a pair of shorts, but the zippers are always broken so they end up playing in skirts…it’s not easy…I tried it one day and fell on my butt within a minute!  Shoes are another story…no running shoes and no boots (soccer cleats).  A used pair of soccer cleats in good condition costs only US$7 from the local market but that’s out of range when your father makes $2 a day to support a family of 6 or more.  So the girls run around on very uneven ground with bare feet and collide into each other without shin guards.  These girls are though, they are aggressive and they are strong athletes.  The other day, we had a game against Kwaito the #1 team in the league.  Besides the fact that they are in their mid-20s, so they are physically much bigger, and have much more experience, they have a very unfair advantage because the entire team is outfitted in cleats.  Our team has the potential to match Kwaito but not when our girls are getting clobbered left and right with spikes taking out toes and ankles.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;inline left&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/malawi/&quot; onclick=&quot;launch_popup(136, 324, 432); return false;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; style=&quot;width: -2px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sibongile going for the ball&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;I want to petition for the league to make and enforce football attire for the field of play.  It should be boots or no boots but none of this half-and-half business….it’s just not safe.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;inline left&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/malawi/&quot; onclick=&quot;launch_popup(138, 411, 432); return false;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; style=&quot;width: -2px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My favorite hair-do (Monica)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;During a recent visit my mom brought a set of jerseys and shorts donated by my Alma matter Boulder High School.  The girls were beyond excited.  I’m secretly hoping that we can get more uniforms donated from high schools in the states to give to some of the other teams.  If you have any ideas let me know and I’ll find a way to get them here.&lt;/p&gt;
