 <title>Art Explains the Beauty of Africa</title>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the joys of being married to an artist, is that my artist accentuates life in her paintings and shows me things I never would have noticed on my own.  If any of you out there are not yet married, I highly recommend that you look into finding yourself an artist as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month Marissa and I took a long 24 hour train ride across the whole of Tanzania.  As we watched the plains and mountains and villages of Africa pass by for hours, we were asking ourselves things like: “Why does this land seem so beautiful?” and “Why is it that I feel like I could stare at this countryside for hours on end and never become tired of it?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer wasn&#039;t clear to me until Marissa started sketching some of the grasslands.  When she finished, she noticed that the pattern in the colors of the grasslands in the sketches, without any conscious effort on her part, ended up matching perfectly with the colors of the rainbow.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In each of her sketches if you follow the pattern of the grass from top to bottom you proceed from a deep violet near the base and continue through the color spectrum up to the red tops of the grasses.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could this be why we could stare at the scenery for hours and hours?? Could this be why the African countryside is so appealing to the eye?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have a look for yourself:&lt;/p&gt;
