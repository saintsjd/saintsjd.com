 <title>Zolozolo Primary School Library Opening Ceremony</title>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;inline left&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/malawi/&quot; onclick=&quot;launch_popup(171, 432, 324); return false;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Yesterday I visited Zolozolo Primary School for the Grand Opening &lt;span class=&quot;inline right&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/malawi/&quot; onclick=&quot;launch_popup(172, 432, 324); return false;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;ceremonies for their new library.  This school recieved 1.5 tons of books from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.worldcare.org&quot;&gt;World Care&lt;/a&gt; shipment.  Zolozolo has dedicated a small room for the library, built shelves, labeled everything by category, and are making arrangements for student library cards and class visits to the library for reading time.  This is a school that only had 1 book per 6 or so kids before this shipment.  They are &lt;span class=&quot;inline left&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/malawi/&quot; onclick=&quot;launch_popup(173, 432, 324); return false;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;proud to have a library and have been incredibly self-motivated and resourceful in getting everything organized so quickly.  As the World Care representative they gave me the honor of cutting the ribbon and opening the door for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Profile of Mzuzu Schools</title>
 <link>http://www.ituprising.com/malawi/blog/marissa/profile_of_mzuzu_schools</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;inline left&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/malawi/&quot; onclick=&quot;launch_popup(149, 432, 324); return false;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; style=&quot;width: -2px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Makeshift Classroom&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;This blog is long, LONG overdue.  Back in April I started visiting local primary (grades 1-8) and secondary (grades 9-12) schools, planning for the distribution of books coming from World Care in Tucson.  We were expecting the container to ship out from the World Care warehouses at the end of May, which would have it arriving in Malawi 3-6 months later.  Just last Friday, October 20th , we received the container in Mzuzu and unloaded 30,000 lbs of books into an empty classroom at Mzuzu University where they will be stored during distribution.  This literally doubles, even quadruples in some cases, the number of books at these schools.  It’s very exciting to be a part of this effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;inline right&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/malawi/&quot; onclick=&quot;launch_popup(148, 640, 387); return false;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; style=&quot;width: -2px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Typical Outdoor Classroom&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Today, two of our 6 six schools came to collect their books!  In two weeks I will be visiting schools with the Distric Education Manager to discuss with teachers and administration ways to use the books in the classroom and manage their new library so students and community members can borrow books.  I claim to be no expert in these things but at least the discussions and planning sessions will take place.  I want to make sure that the books get USED, no just sit “safely” in a locked room or closet.  &lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The Box Project</title>
 <link>http://www.ituprising.com/malawi/blog/marissa/the_box_project</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Our so called “Box Project” involves a large shipment of humanitarian aid supplies that will be delivered to Malawi through collaboration between World Care International and the University of Arizona.  World Care is directed and founded by Lisa Hopper, a former teacher, who has experience shipping aid supplies to more than 30 different countries over the last ten years. Hopper and her volunteers are especially experts in getting books and school supplies into the hands of children and communities in developing countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will be World Care’s first shipment to Malawi, for which they are partnering with Dr. Wayne Decker and his International Studies students from the University of Arizona.  Three students are responsible for fundraising the $15,000 needed to cover transport costs, while World Care will provide all of the supplies to fill a 40ft shipping container. This is serious business!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As many of you know, Jon and I are both graduates of the International Studies program and remain in close contact with Dr.Decker.  We have been recruited to receive and distribute the aid supplies while we are here in Malawi. Currently we are doing our ground work to understand the transportation network from ports in Tanzania, Mozambique and South Africa to Malawi (a land-locked country with a minimally functional rail system). We are also assessing needs in the areas of education, health and technology to inform World Care of supplies that would been most appropriate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check back for updates on fundraising, shipping, distribution and plans for future shipments to Malawi.&lt;/p&gt;
