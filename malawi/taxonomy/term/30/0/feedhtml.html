 <title>Case Study: Overcoming the Digital Divide in Malawi</title>
 <link>http://www.saintsjd.com/malawi/blog/jon/case_study_overcoming_the_digital_divide_in_malawi</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Our last week in Malawi, and there is one final success story to report! It seems the internet connectivity will be coming this year to the development offices of the CCAP church (Church of Central Africa Presbyterian) in Ekwendeni (just 15km north of Mzuzu).  I am very excited.  Some of the most effective aide offices in all of Malawi are based in Ekwendeni and run by the CCAP church there. Decent internet connectivity is only going to increase the productivity of people who are already doing some of the most effective development work in Malawi: fighting the spread of AIDS, opening clean water sources, treating sickness, and creating education and job opportunities for Malawians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The manner in which the offices and organizations of Ekwendeni were able to &quot;bridge the Digtial Divide&quot; and obtain internet connectivity is fascinating and, I think, useful for others in remote parts of the world who are interested in connecting.  There are three steps to achieving connectivity off the main communications grid:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resource Pooling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Often connectivity options are only accessible if a number of people and organizations pool their financial resources together. In the case of Ekwendeni in Malawi, the CCAP church offices there were each asked how much per month they could contribute to internet connectivity per month and front for installation costs at their office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the budget was finalized various ISPs in the capital city Lilongwe were approached with the budgets and asked to submit competitive proposals for providing as much bandwidth as possible given the budget constraints of the CCAP offices. Also companies were asked to provide plans for sharing the connection among the various offices once internet connectivity had been establish successfully to a single point on the CCAP campus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within one month 4 companies had responded. One said that they could not offer anything for the budget that CCAP had provided. Three others returned with proposals for various different connectivity options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By pooling resources and approaching the ISPs directly, the offices of the CCAP retroactively created a market and brought it to the attention of ISPs that were too far away and too unaware of the connectivity needs 500km away. This approach was much more effective that their previous attempts where they had called up ISPs and simply said that they were &quot;interested in getting an internet connection&quot;. For the ISPs in the capital city, everyone is &quot;interested in getting a connection&quot;, the trick is identifying serious buyers who have enough resources to pay. The resource pooling strategy gave ISPs a immediate idea of the seriousness of the CCAP and brought to their attention that connecting the CCAP would be profitable endeavor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Engineering as Development&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
From the standpoint of the ISPs, the proposal by CCAP came at a very fortunate time. Until very recently, the only option for connecting a site like Ekwendeni had been to license and install a dedicated VSAT satellite internet connection. It was only within the last year that some new wireless technology allowed ISPs to use existing cell phone towers to relay data back to shared VSATs in larger cities from remote areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These new technologies drastically lowered the price of connecting remote places like Equindeni, and made it possible for some the of ISPs to offer profitable internet service to the CCAP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Macro Level Internet Policy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The national regulation of the internet in Malawi also played a huge role in the internet connectivity of CCAP in Ekwendeni. In Malawi, there are steep regulation fees that must be paid on VSAT internet connections. These fees are so steep that they effectively price a VSAT out of the budget of the CCAP. During the time when the VSAT was the only connectivity option, essentially this meant that these fines priced the whole internet out of the budget of the CCAP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But with the new cellular rely wireless technology, that is not tightly regulated by the government, it became affordable for CCAP to connect.  While these regulations are out of the power of individuals and organizations to control, individual organizations can play a role in publicizing their inefficiencies and ineffectiveness to the government and to decision makers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It was the combination of resource pooling, engineering, policy that finally made the CCAP a true market for high speed internet connectivity.  The combination of these three factors all coming together at the right time are finally what will bring reliable, powerful, capable connectivity to the office of the CCAP that were once on the wrong side of the Digital Divide.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Network Monitoring with Ubuntu</title>
 <link>http://www.saintsjd.com/malawi/blog/jon/network_monitoring_with_ubuntu</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I am starting to publish the final results of my Fulbright research. Here is an article I published on the Ubuntu Linux Community wiki about creating a network monitoring server to analyze traffic on your network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has proven to be an essential tool for my resaerch and for improving the campus network at Mzuzu University.  If you want detailed analysis of who is doing what on your computer network, this &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.ubuntu.com/community/NetworkMonitoringBridge&quot;&gt;Network Monitoring Bridge&lt;/a&gt; is for you.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Gmail over Low Bandwidth Connections</title>
 <link>http://www.saintsjd.com/malawi/blog/jon/gmail_over_low_bandwidth_connections</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I have noticed that the Gmail folks have made improvements to their web interface for people connecting over low bandwidth or unreliable internet connections.  They now display a message that says something like: &quot;your connection is too slow, click HERE to view your mail using standard HTML view.&quot;  This is great, but sometimes still, its not enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are two tricks we use to access Gmail from Malawi:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mozilla.com/thunderbird/&quot;&gt;Mozilla Thunderbrid&lt;/a&gt; and use &lt;a href=&quot;http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=38343&quot;&gt;Gmail&#039;s POP capabilities&lt;/a&gt; to access your mail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also instead of going to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gmail.com&quot;&gt;http://www.gmail.com&lt;/a&gt; try going to &lt;a href=&quot;http://m.gmail.com&quot;&gt;http://m.gmail.com&lt;/a&gt;. This is the mobile version of gmail intended for cellphones and PDAs. It is very simple interface without unnecessary pictures or text and also works great on your desktop when you are on an unreliable internet connections&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

 <title>VSAT Community Networks</title>
 <link>http://www.saintsjd.com/malawi/blog/jon/vsat_community_networks</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I just read that the internet is growing &lt;a href=&quot;http://allafrica.com/stories/200604280398.html&quot;&gt;faster in Africa than anywhere else in the world&lt;/a&gt;.  Most of us here in Africa are connecting via satellite or VSAT connections which are a fairly expensive way to transmit data (though costs are rapidly dropping).  While I am finding sufficient knowledge on &lt;a href=&quot;http://ictinafrica.com/vsat/index.php&quot;&gt;how to purchase VSATs&lt;/a&gt;, I have found very little discussion or collaboration online concerning how best to maintain VSAT internet connections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just yesterday I received an email from a friend here in Malawi describing the experience of another friend who “successfully” installed a VSAT connection for their NGO.  The NGO found that the the installers from the company they hired to install the VSAT “haven&#039;t got a clue [how to install a VSAT]. It took them over 10 days to get it running - basically they installed it and it didn&#039;t work and they couldn&#039;t work out why.” After asking help from a local internet cafe owner the NGO found “the VSAT company had supplied the wrong kind of network cable (not a cross over one) - a fairly basic mistake and they haven&#039;t apologised or anything - so we&#039;re not really very impressed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poor quality technical support seems to be a common complaint of those organizations installing VSATs.  Often the price for poor technical support in VSAT service contracts is very high. Organizations are usually asked to pay travel, room and board expenses for foreign technical support consultants in addition to paying fees for fixing connection problems.  In the case of the University here in Mzuzu, we have found that maintaining the connection can be challenging because the network infrastructure was designed by outside consultants.  Very few of the skills needed to keep the VSAT running optimally were transferred in documentation or training to the University IT staff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here in Mzuzu there is some consensus that organizations using VSATs could themselves improve technical support services while reducing service contract costs by collaborating online.  We are interested in creating an online community to help other organizations around the world sustain and manage their VSAT internet connections.  This would include: tools/guides to help organizations estimate and budget for usage costs, a tutorial collection to help build staff capacity for maintaining the VSAT and reduce dependence on outside consultants, a collection of success stories and best practices/uses for internet (giving professors blogs, etc), an online forum for technical questions to be answered by other members of VSAT community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other phase of our work here involves designing open source software to control, allocate and optimize network bandwidth on the VSAT (as I discussed before).  I truly believe that this is the this is the other piece of the puzzle that could really fuel of fire of internet development here in Africa.   User friendly software that turns old PCs into network appliances for allocating bandwidth would empower community groups, NGOs, churches, universities, and cities and allow them to collectively purchase VSAT equipment and distrubute and manage their bandwidth according each organizations contribution towards the connection cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have found that the NoCat (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nocat.net&quot;&gt;http://www.nocat.net&lt;/a&gt;) project is pretty much what we need to begin allocating bandwidth based upon user logins.  It is a great community networking product, but the problem is, the project stopped development sometime in 2004. Currently assessing the state of the NoCat code to see if it suits our needs and can be built upon.  We are also looking into rolling out our own system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a more technical details of the community network system we are trying to create:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Place a Linux authentication gateway to filter all network traffic just before it is sent out the VSAT to the rest of the world
&lt;li&gt;The authentication gateway should optionally allow unlimited local network traffic (email, file and print sharing, web browsing)
&lt;li&gt;When a user tries to send data out to the world through the VSAT, the authentication gateway captures the request and the user is asked to login
&lt;li&gt;After logging in network bandwidth limits are set on the gateway on a per user basis according to which network privileges the user has been granted.  These are settings controlled by the network administrator.
&lt;li&gt;The user is shown how much network time they have remaining in their account, how much bandwidth has been allocated to them etc.
&lt;li&gt;The user is redirected to the website the originally requested before the capture. A small javascipt frame in the web browser continually checks in with the authentication gateway so that the gateway knows the user is still using the network.
&lt;li&gt;Once logged in the user can send any type of network requests that are permitted by the network administrator through the VSAT
&lt;li&gt;To end the VSAT network session the user closes their web browser
&lt;li&gt;The authentication gateway notices that the user has not checked in for some time and closes network access to the VSAT for the user.
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NoCat does most of this already, but is lacking an accounting system that would permit easy creation of network access limits for groups of users.  Now to figure out if we can add it to the system... I love nerding.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Differences between internet connectivity in Colorado and Malawi</title>
 <link>http://www.saintsjd.com/malawi/blog/jon/differences_between_internet_connectivity_in_colorado_and_malawi</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Malawians, in general, are both very poor and very ambitious.  I think this is why I am finding engineering in Malawi to be such exhilarating experience.  So often here we are asked to do a lot with a little.  Its forcing me to push the limits my creativity, my imagination, and my skills as an engineer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was in a meeting last week to discuss the redesign of the internet network architecture for Mzuzu University.  There is a need to rethink how users are allowed to connect to the internet here in Mzuzu.  Currently the network is designed much like the networks of the universities in the USA.  In general, computers with connections allow users are to have unlimited access to the internet.  A quick comparison of the internet connection here in Mzuzu to the last connection I used at my house in the USA will show why a different network architecture is necessary in Mzuzu:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border=&quot;1px&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Mzuzu University&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;My Mountain House in Colorado&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Bandwidth (speed of connection)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;256 kbps&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&gt; 1000 kbps&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Number of users the connection serves&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;about 500&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Price per month &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;at least $300 - $400 (this could be much more, but getting the actual numbers has been tough) &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;$55&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In English the table basically says: In Mzuzu we are trying to serve about 500 people with an internet connection that is about 5 times slower than the one broadband users have at home in the USA. This same slower connection costs us about 6-8 times what it costs home users in the states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, the trick is to do a lot with a little.  At home in the USA where there is a lot of cheap extra bandwidth readily available the efficiency of the design of your home network is not of much concern.  If for example there is a virus sitting on your home computer sending out data via your internet connection, chances are the data the virus sends costs you very little money.  Here in Malawi this is not the case. Over our satellite internet connection, bandwidth is scarce.  Viruses sending out data cost us a lot of money.  For many reasons of both, economics and engineering, we need to be very efficient here with how data is sent from our network out to the world via the internet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Mzuzu University has put together a team of myself, a volunteer from Japan and the university IT staff to design a system network architecture to use the resources of the VSAT internet connection more efficiently.  We decided unanimously that we would try our best to carefully document the system we design so that it could be easily implemented by other universities who use satellites to connect to the internet.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall our goal is to design a system that gives as much free access to the internet as the University can afford.  We want to limit users only so that they realize their internet time is expensive and should be used only in the most productive ways.  By limiting the number of hours users have available for free they will respect the time available to them more and will begin to treat the internet as a limited resource. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our first meeting we decided the requirements for the new university network. I am posting them here in hopes that some of you computer networking nerds out there might take internet in the project.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The requirements :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The network should allow users unlimited access to the local network (intra-univeristy network traffic like email , file sharing, and web browsing cost us very very little and should be allowed to happen all of the time)
&lt;li&gt;Only network traffic sent via the VSAT to the rest of the world should be limited (this is the expensive network traffic)
&lt;li&gt;the University has decided on set number of free hours for various groups (staff, students, administration, etc) available per week or per semester and on a pricing schedule for additional internet time.  The network should track individual users use of the VSAT connection and limit their connectivity based upon the limits defined by type of user they are ( for example, a student may be given 3 hours of free connectivity per semester, while a staff member may receive 5 hours per week).
&lt;li&gt;The pricing architecture should allow administration to change pricing of internet access easily and frequently
&lt;li&gt;Users should be able to view their reaming time and account balances
&lt;li&gt;Users should be notified with their remaining free time or account balance is low
&lt;li&gt;System should allow large files and full mirrors of websites to be downloaded during off peak hours for internet usage (nights and weekends) at no charge to University network users
&lt;li&gt;When power goes out the system should automatically credit one minute to users accounts and stop deducting time
&lt;li&gt;new network should continue to use the web proxy cache already in place to minimize duplicate downloads
&lt;li&gt;new network should include bandwidth optimization and local queuing of internet traffic to allow highly interactive traffic like Voice over internet, Video conferencing, ssh, web browsing to take priority over non-interactive uses of the internet connection like file downloads (this will also discourage large number of large files from being downloaded as they will go at slower and slower rates without affecting interactive web traffic)
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thoughts anyone?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>One thousand roads and no highway...</title>
 <link>http://www.saintsjd.com/malawi/blog/jon/one_thousand_roads_and_no_highway</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Three days into our Malawi adventure and my head is full of questions.  I think that I have pieced together a reasonable view of what the internet infrastructure looks like in Malawi through various meetings at the US embassy here in Lilongwe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that in Malawi, any government office, international organization or private company who wants to connect to the internet does so by buying their own VSAT satellites.  Its essentially every person for themselves, as each organization takes their chunk of capital and builds their own personal pipeline.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its as if a village of people wanted to travel to a distant city, instead of pooling resources to build a highway that would provide faster/more reliable/efficient transportation, the people each decided to carve their own individual narrow roads to the far away city.  There is an unbelieved able amount of upkeep and investment costs associated with keeping these &quot;individual roads&quot; or fragmented internet oasises running.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This fragmentation is frustrating to me, again, I am new here, but it seems that these VSATs are very sort-term and individualized solutions that serve very few people. They could never really be the economic catalysts to Malawi that I think the internet should be. Maybe I am naive, but It makes me wonder if some sort of resource pooling campaign couldn&#039;t be possible to link up to the nearest fiber connection here in Africa?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a rumor here in Malawi that there is no wire that crosses the Malawian border... not power... not electricity... not data.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder where the nearest fiber optic cable is to Malawi? Who could I begin asking? Could it be streched here?&lt;/p&gt;
